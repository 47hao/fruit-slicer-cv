# game.py is the main program file. You do not need to import any modules or install anything. Everything is run on cmu_112_graphics.

# Welcome to Definately Not Fruit Ninja. Fruits fly up from the ground and you drag your mouse over them to slice. The more you slice, the more points you get. If you press 'o', there will be a zero gravity mode, so you can slice to your heart's content.
# 
# The slicing algorithm uses Sutherland-Hodgman polygon clipping, so the slicing is more exact than fruit ninja (and you can slice it into a bunch of tiny little pieces).
